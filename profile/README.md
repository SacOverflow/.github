## Collaboration Guidelines
We follow these guidelines for a smooth developer and team experience within this organization / team:

### Git & Branching
- **Branch Naming**: Create a dedicated branch for each Jira ticket assigned, following a naming convention such as `ISSUE-KEY` (e.g: `SO-94 (Optional Description)`)
- **Branching**: Base your branch off the most stable branch (e.g. `main`) to ensure code stability
- **Pull Requests**: Submit a Pull Request (PR) for each branch once the task is complete for review before merging. 
- **Code Reviews**: All code changes must undergo a code review process, with at least two team members reviewing each PR.


### Jira Integration
- **Task Tracking**: We utilize Jira to assign and track tasks, helping us maintain project progress and transparency.
- **Ticket Assignments**: For each sprint, every member must be assigned to specific individual Jira Tickets and responsible for completing those tasks. Each team member is required to dedicate a minimum of 4 hours per sprint.

### Communication
- **Regular updates**: Please stay active and provide regular status updates on youir work to keep the team informed. Don't hesitate to ask for help when needed.

### Code Quality
- **Documentation**: Maintain well-documented code and contribute to project documentation when making major changes, with approval from the **entire** team.
- **Code Standards**: Adhere to coding standards, making use of TypeScripts static typing and avoiding the use of the `any` object type. Utilize tools like Prettier and ESLint for long-term maintenance and debugging.
